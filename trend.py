#To show trends in the scatter plot, you can add trend lines or regression lines for each approach. These lines can help visualize the general direction and strength of the relationship between the number of recommended workers and precision. Here's how you can modify the code to include trend lines:


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from numpy.polynomial.polynomial import Polynomial

# Simulated data for demonstration purposes
recommended_workers = np.arange(1, 21)  # Number of recommended workers (1 to 20)
precision_consensus = np.random.uniform(0.5, 0.9, 20)  # Consensus-based precision scores (0.5 to 0.9)
precision_reputation = np.random.uniform(0.6, 0.95, 20)  # Reputation-based precision scores (0.6 to 0.95)
precision_gold = np.random.uniform(0.7, 0.98, 20)  # Gold standard precision scores (0.7 to 0.98)

# Create a scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(recommended_workers, precision_consensus, label='Consensus-based', color='blue')
plt.scatter(recommended_workers, precision_reputation, label='Reputation-based', color='green')
plt.scatter(recommended_workers, precision_gold, label='Gold Standard', color='gold')

# Fit polynomial trend lines (you can adjust the degree)
degree = 2
trend_consensus = Polynomial.fit(recommended_workers, precision_consensus, degree)
trend_reputation = Polynomial.fit(recommended_workers, precision_reputation, degree)
trend_gold = Polynomial.fit(recommended_workers, precision_gold, degree)

# Plot trend lines
plt.plot(recommended_workers, trend_consensus(recommended_workers), color='blue', linestyle='dashed')
plt.plot(recommended_workers, trend_reputation(recommended_workers), color='green', linestyle='dashed')
plt.plot(recommended_workers, trend_gold(recommended_workers), color='gold', linestyle='dashed')

# Set plot labels and title
plt.xlabel('Number of Recommended Workers')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Comparison of Precision for Different Trustworthiness Assessment Approaches')
plt.legend()

plt.show()


#In this modified code, we've used the `numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial` class to fit polynomial trend lines (you can adjust the degree of the polynomial). The trend lines are plotted as dashed lines alongside the scatter points. Adjust the degree of the polynomial and other plotting parameters as needed to best represent the trends in your data.
